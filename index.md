## Choosing the Right Sport Climbing Route for You

What does it take to become a better sport climber? If you could teleport to any climbing area in the United States, where should you go?

### Map View

Take a look at this map of the more than 54,000 sport climbing routes entered in MountainProject, with the color of each point corresponding to the difficulty rating assigned to it. The distribution of the routes is not exactly surprising, with the vast majority of them seeming to be located around the Appalachians and the Rockies, depending on which coast you happen to live on.

Unfortunately, while this view of the data is interesting, it doesn't give our hypothetical climber much of an idea of which route to pick. With this many routes, there are likely infinite combinations of hold type, rock shape, and climbing style.  

What differentiates a 5.8 from a 5.11?
Technical skills? Raw strength? Endurance? Grip strength and form? How much of it is overcoming common fears like making dynamic moves, hanging upside down, or just a general unsafe feeling?

### The Data

Using data scraped from the MountainProject database in August 2020 hosted by openbeta.io, we've analyzed the climber-entered descriptions for each route to determine what skills a climber needs to possess to successfully climb at a higher level.

In the rock climbing community, difficulty ratings for climbing routes range from 5.0 to 5.15, with +/- or a/b/c/d modifiers to further expand the scale. For simplicity, we’ve divided these into the following four groups:

5.10a and below: Beginner
5.10a/b through 5.10d: Intermediate
5.11a-d: Advanced
5.12a and above: Elite

Route descriptions entered into MountainProject are packed with rock climbing slang that, while providing great opportunities for analysis, can be difficult for a newcomer to understand. Some words will be explained along the way, and we’ve included a brief glossary at the end for the rest.

### Keywords of Interest that We Identified

We began our analysis of the reviews by filtering out filler words, such as prepositions, articles, etc. Then, we identified 88 different keywords from the reviews. The number of times each word appears in the dataset is shown above.

However, this still isn't exactly the most helpful in terms of our ultimate goal. We need to drill down further, so next, we identified distinct categories for the routes themselves.

### Categorizing the Routes

### Keywords Common Between Categories

In the above view, if you sort the words by the "Beginner" difficulty category, you will see the words sorted by their frequency in easier routes. You can see how certain keywords pertain to different difficulties.
For example, the word "slab" is more common with beginner routes, and becomes less common as the difficulty increases. This is due to the fact
that "slab" references a route that is fairly straightforward and vertical, which helps to make a route easier. 

On the other hand, a route with more "roof" elements is increasingly more common in harder routes,
because a roof is more horizontal, which requires a climber to be more parallel to the ground when they climb this section. Climbing a roof requires a great deal of effort, which is why it
seems to be associated with more challenging routes.
